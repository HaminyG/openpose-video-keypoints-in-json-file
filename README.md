# openpose-video-keypoints-in-json-file
Hi, after going through the openpose project, I found out the code from CMU provided was not matched with my purpose.
I have video dataset which need to generate keypoints for our project. But I didn't find there is a solution from openpose Github.
So I wrote by myself. I hope it will be helpful for you to use openpose.

My datasets format maybe not as yours, so you can implement your own code to deal with your datasets.
This code will accept the video file for input. 
English is not my mother language, so if there are any grammar problems, please let me know.
And if you have issue to implement the code, let me know and I will help you out. Thanks
